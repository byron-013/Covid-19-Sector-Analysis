# Covid-19-Sector-Analysis

# About 
The program uses user-selected stocks or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to simulate sector portfolios. It runs two linear regressions for each of the 11 sectors, comparing portfolio/ETF closing prices with unemployment rates and days since COVID-19 began. 

The single variable regression model is used to analyze the relationship between each sector and the selected variable, providing a more granular view of the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors.

The program is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to select their stocks or ETFs, choose the variables for the regression, and interpret the results. It also provides guidance on how to transform the data if needed and how to interpret the regression summary results.


# Project Background
This project originated from a business statistics assignment I completed in sophomore year of college using Excel. I decided to expand on it and developed a Python program to streamline the analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19. The project required that we find and analyze a public data set using single variable linear regressions and present the findings. 

Through hypothesis testing, we found significant impacts in the hospitality and travel sectors, indicating these industries were particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. The technology sector on the other hand had the opposite effect which we expected due to the fact that the lockdown forced demand for online services to increase. These findings were presented at the end of 2020.

# Data Science Skills Exhibited
This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision making in times of crisis and showcases my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets. It stands as a testament to my skills in economic analysis, data interpretation, and strategic thinking, all of which are crucial in the field of data science.


This project also exhibits my ability to obtain data sets and preprocess them for analyzing (outliers removed, irrelevant data removed, several data sets integrated, data standardized)

This may not have been the most advanced analysis, but it was a requirement by the professor that we use single variable regressions. 
Regardless, it is a thorough analysis of all the relevant data that was readily available, and I did use it to make a few profitable investments (details below) at the start of the pandemic. 

Due to my understanding of the linear regression and the fact that the stock price and unemployment rate was correlated with other (political/social) factors it was easy to see trends in the data and distinguish when those trends were being artificially made by the other factors (like policy). 
This shows my ability to take data and make informed financial decisions based on my findings and my given analysis method.

### Details on investments made based on project findings:
After looking at the regression results in 2020 and triple checking everything to make sure that my conclusions were statistically supported I invested Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. As predicted by the regression results, the pandemic continued to cause the stock prices of these companies to increase and I made a profit when I sold my shares.
I also took note of the negative effect on the transportation sector: airline companies specifically. It was clear that this was a direct cause of the travel ban, and since air travel is not something that can be replaced (at least not yet), I decided to buy some airline stocks and wait for the stock price to return to what it was pre pandemic. Once travel opened back up in 2022 I sold my shares for a profit.
