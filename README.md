# Covid-19-Sector-Analysis
This project originated from a business statistics assignment I completed in school using Excel. I decided to expand on it and developed a Python program to streamline the analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19. The project now includes a single variable linear regression model that I implemented from scratch, demonstrating my understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and my ability to apply them in a practical context.

The program uses user-selected stocks or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to simulate sector portfolios. It runs two linear regressions for each of the 11 sectors, comparing portfolio/ETF closing prices with unemployment rates and days since COVID-19 began. The single variable regression model is used to analyze the relationship between each sector and the selected variable, providing a more granular view of the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors.

Through hypothesis testing, we found significant impacts in the hospitality and travel sectors, indicating these industries were particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. These findings were presented at the end of 2020.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply statistical techniques to real-world economic data and make data-driven decisions. It also showcases my skills in Python programming, data cleaning, data visualization, and hypothesis testing. The insights derived from this project led to a more advanced multivariable analysis project.

The program is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to select their stocks or ETFs, choose the variables for the regression, and interpret the results. It also provides guidance on how to transform the data if needed and how to interpret the regression results.

This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision making in times of crisis and showcases my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets. It stands as a testament to my skills in economic analysis, data interpretation, and strategic thinking, all of which are crucial in the field of data science. I hope you find it insightful and useful. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
